RAINDROP CAKE(Mizu shingen mochi)

Mizu shingen mochi (水信玄餅), better known as the raindrop cake, is an agar-agar jelly that looks like a large ball of water. It’s pretty, but because it’s mostly made of water, it doesn’t taste like much. It’s typically paired with kuromitsu and kinako, a type of powdered roasted soybean, but you can use any topping you like.
